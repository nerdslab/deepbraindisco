## Welcome to Deep Brain Discovery (DeepBrainDisco)!

Join us on our journey of revealing structure and organization in a thalamocortical slice of the mouse brain using a deep convolutional neural network, non-negative matrix factorization and gaussian mixture models :)

## Data

Our dataset consists of a 3D brain volume, generated via microCT, spanning from hypothalamus to cortex. It has the dimensions 720x1420x5805 (z,y,x), with a 1.17um isotropic voxel volume. The brain areas available are Cortex, Striatum, Ventral Posterior, Zona Incerta, Hypothalamus, and White Matter (Internal Capsule + Corpus Callosum).
The data was collected, processed and analyzed by Prasad et al. as described in the paper, "A three-dimensional X-ray microtomography thalamocortical dataset for characterizing brain heterogeneity" and is publicly <a href = "http://bossdb.org/project/prasad2020" Target = "_blank">available</a>.
