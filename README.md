## Welcome to Deep Brain Discovery a.k.a. DeepBrainDisco!

Models of neural architecture and organization are critical for the study of disease, aging, and development. In our work, "<a href="" target="_blank">Deep Brain Discovery</a>" we leverage deep neural networks to build robust and expressive data-driven models of brain structure across multiple, diversified brain regions. In particular, we show how one can use representations extracted from trained deep learning models to learn *meaningful features* for modeling neural architecture, and through vignettes present ways to utilize these features for the discovery of new regions of interest and anatomical motifs within the sample.
